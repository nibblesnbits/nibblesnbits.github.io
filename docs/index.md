    My resume can be found [here](/resume.pdf){: target=_blank }, and my portfolio [here](https://nibblesnbits.github.io/).

My name is Stephen Collins, and I am a Software Developer, currently serving as the Technical Lead at [Ostrich](https://getostrich.com){: target=_blank } and [TMS Titanium](https://tmstitanium.com/)

I'm not just a programmer, not just a coder.  I have spent the last 30 years of my life focused on honing my skills in creating high quality software.  I craft products that I can be proud of.

After spending the last 10 years in various development roles, I can confidently say I am not your typical code monkey.  Not because I would be so brash to assume I am inherently more talented or intelligent than my colleagues, but simply that I care.  I care about the quality of my code.  I care about the experience of the users utilizing the software I write and contribute to.  I care about the level of pain other developers may have to deal with when modifying code I have written.  I care about the long-term effects of changes to a codebase.

I'm not a cog that churns out code without regard for anything but “getting the job done.” I'm a craftsman who carefully and meticulously devises the best possible solution to every problem presented, with the help of other experts.

You can contact me via email at [sgcollins@outlook.com](mailto:sgcollins@outlook.com).

If you want a real look into how I view software, check out my appearance on the Silicon Alley Podcast:
