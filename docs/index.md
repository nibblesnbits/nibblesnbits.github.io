My name is Stephen Collins, and I am a Software Developer.  Not just a programmer, not just a coder.  I have spent the last 25+ years of my life focused on honing my skills in creating high quality software.  I craft products that I can be proud of.

After spending the last 10 years in a software, I can confidently say I am not your typical code monkey.  Not because I would be so brash to assume I am inherently more talented or intelligent than my colleagues, but simply that I care.  I care about the quality of my code.  I care about the experience of the users utilizing the software I write and contribute to.  I care about the level of pain other developers may have to deal with when modifying code I have written.  I care about the long-term effects of changes to a codebase.
