# About Me

I'm a lifelong geek and software craftsman with a deep love for well-built systems, maintainable code, and thoughtful user experiences. I’ve spent over 12 years in professional software roles, backed by 30 years of programming across everything from early scripting languages to modern cloud-native stacks.

Most recently, I served as Technical Lead at [Ostrich](https://getostrich.com), where I helped architect and build a financial accountability platform from the ground up. I’m currently open to new full-time opportunities, freelance contracts, or ambitious collaborations.

## My Philosophy

I'm not here to “just ship it.” I write code like I’m going to read it five years from now—while juggling a production fire and a coffee spill. I believe in thoughtful abstractions, clean interfaces, and the kind of documentation that makes future-you want to buy past-you a beer.

Whether I’m leading teams or building solo, my approach is pragmatic, precise, and always people-centered. Software is for humans. So is the code behind it.

## Technical Expertise

### 🛠️ .NET & C&#x23;
C# has been my “native tongue” since 2001. I’ve built enterprise-grade systems, microservices, and cloud-native APIs with .NET 6+, both on Windows and Linux environments.

### ⚙️ Node.js
A staple in my toolbelt for over 6 years. I love Node.js for its speed of development and flexibility with schema-less data. Perfect for horizontally scalable systems.

### 🗄️ SQL Server & MongoDB
Whether the data’s strictly relational or loosely structured, I’m fluent. SQL Server is my default for tight schema control, MongoDB for high-throughput semi-structured data pipelines.

### 💻 React & Relay
When UIs get complex, I reach for React. I’m particularly fond of combining it with GraphQL and Relay for expressive, efficient data handling. I'm keeping close tabs on Concurrent Mode.

### 🔍 GraphQL
One of my favorite recent evolutions in API design. I love its balance of strictness and flexibility, and I’ve implemented it cleanly across both Node and .NET environments.

### 📘 Documentation
I believe good docs are an act of care. This site reflects that mindset—clear, intentional, and written for humans, not just compilers.

## Clients

Alongside my full-time roles, I’ve worked with some fantastic teams:

- **[Craimark](https://craimark.com/)** — Long-time partner in media-rich marketing and production.
- **[Gomigo](https://gomigo.app/)** — A social app rethinking how people meet up.
- **[Ostrich](https://getostrich.com/)** — Financial wellness through community accountability.
- **[ECP, Inc.](https://www.ecpinc.net/)** — Automotive protection backed by decades of reliability.
