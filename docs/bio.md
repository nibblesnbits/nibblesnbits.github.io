# About Me

I'm a life-long geek who's passionate about software quality.  The bulk of my experience is in back-end technologies, though I've done some front-end work as well, my favorite so far being a combination of React and Relay.

## Expertise

I've built my skill set over the years to include many well-known established technologies as well as a few cutting-edge stacks.

### .NET

I've been working in the typical Microsoft stack since 2001, and consider C# my "native language."  I find this stack a perfect solution when strong typing is needed. 

### Node.js

I picked up Node.js about 6 years ago and have loved it from day one.  It's especially great with when you need to deal with data of any shape with low-overhead maintenance and makes for quick development of easily horizontally scalable systems and Microservices architectures.

### SQL Server

Microsoft SQL Server is my typical go-to for applications in need of an RDBMS.  It's solid and fast; a perfect choice for strictly-structured data. 

### MongoDB

I've used MongoDB for a whole range of projects.  It's ability to handle large data loads and semi-structured data is unbeatable.

### React

React has been my go-to for UIs that require complex interaction and complex data.  I'm patiently waiting the stable release of Concurrent Mode.

### GraphQL

My new current love affair is a whole new approach to accessing data on the client.  An advantage of GraphQL is that it's a spec, not a technology implemented in one way, so when it's needed, it's typically easy to use regardless of your stack.

### Documentation

I'm a huge fan of good documentation (hence the layout of this site), and will always take the time to create it when feasible.

## Clients

I also do some contract work from time to time.

### [Craimark](https://craimark.com/)

My longest-running client, Craimark is top-notch when it comes to video production and marketing.

### [Gomigo](https://gomigo.app/)

Gomigo will soon be a game-changer when it comes to easily meeting up with friends.

### [Ostrich](https://getostrich.com/)

Building better financial habits is something everyone can get behind, and Ostrich is a great place to start making that happen.

### [ECP, Inc.](https://www.ecpinc.net/)

ECP has been providing high quality protective coatings for automobiles for over 50 years.
