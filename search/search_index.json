Not just a programmer, not just a coder. I have spent the last 25+ years of my life focused on honing my skills in creating high quality software. I craft products that I can be proud of. After spending the last 10 years in various development roles, I can confidently say I am not your typical code monkey. Not because I would be so brash to assume I am inherently more talented or intelligent than my colleagues, but simply that I care. I care about the quality of my code. I care about the experience of the users utilizing the software I write and contribute to. I care about the level of pain other developers may have to deal with when modifying code I have written. I care about the long-term effects of changes to a codebase. I'm not a cog that churns out code without regard for anything but \u201cgetting the job done.\u201d I'm a craftsman who carefully and meticulously devises the best possible solution to every problem presented, with the help of other experts. My resume can be found here . You can contact me via email at stephen@nibblesnbits.net . If you want a real look into how I view software, check out my appearance on the Silicon Alley Podcast:","title":"Hi, there."},{"location":"bio/","text":"About Me I'm a life-long geek who's passionate about software quality. The bulk of my experience is in back-end technologies, though I've done some front-end work as well, my favorite so far being a combination of React and Relay. Expertise I've built my skill set over the years to include many well-known established technologies as well as a few cutting-edge stacks. .NET I've been working in the typical Microsoft stack since 2001, and consider C# my \"native language.\" I find this stack a perfect solution when strong typing is needed. Node.js I picked up Node.js about 6 years ago and have loved it from day one. It's especially great with when you need to deal with data of any shape with low-overhead maintenance and makes for quick development of easily horizontally scalable systems and Microservices architectures. SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server is my typical go-to for applications in need of an RDBMS. It's solid and fast; a perfect choice for strictly-structured data. MongoDB I've used MongoDB for a whole range of projects. It's ability to handle large data loads and semi-structured data is unbeatable. React React has been my go-to for UIs that require complex interaction and complex data. I'm patiently waiting the stable release of Concurrent Mode. GraphQL My new current love affair is a whole new approach to accessing data on the client. An advantage of GraphQL is that it's a spec, not a technology implemented in one way, so when it's needed, it's typically easy to use regardless of your stack. Documentation I'm a huge fan of good documentation (hence the layout of this site), and will always take the time to create it when feasible. Clients I also do some contract work from time to time. Craimark My longest-running client, Craimark is top-notch when it comes to video production and marketing. Gomigo Gomigo will soon be a game-changer when it comes to easily meeting up with friends. Ostrich Building better financial habits is something everyone can get behind, and Ostrich is a great place to start making that happen. ECP, Inc. ECP has been providing high quality protective coatings for automobiles for over 50 years.","title":"Bio"},{"location":"bio/#about-me","text":"I'm a life-long geek who's passionate about software quality.
